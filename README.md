# Simulation code for Three Stage Reactor Cascade with Countercurrent-Cooling
This repository provides the python code for the simulation example in our paper: Soft-Sensor Development through Deep Learning with Spatial and Temporal Feature Extraction of Complex Processes. 
The generated dataset is also provided. The dataset.csv saves the simulated data involving all the input and the output variables in a sampling interval of 1 minute.
Be free to use the code to construct your simulated dataset by changing model parameters, according to the annotations in the file.
